# Example 1
# Input: nums = [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2, 3, 7, 101], therefore the length is 4

# Example 2
# Input: nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 2, 3]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [0, 1, 2, 3], therefore the length is 4
