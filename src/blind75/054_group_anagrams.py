# Example 1
# Input: strs = ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]
# Output: [["eat", "tea", "ate"], ["tan", "nat"], ["bat"]]
# Explanation: The words that are anagrams of each other are grouped together

# Example 2
# Input: strs = [""]
# Output: [[""]]
# Explanation: There is only one word, which forms its own group
