# Example 1
# Input: m = 3, n = 7
# Output: 28
# Explanation: From top-left to bottom-right, there are 28 unique paths

# Example 2
# Input: m = 3, n = 2
# Output: 3
# Explanation: From top-left to bottom-right, there are 3 unique paths: right -> down -> down, down -> right -> down, down -> down -> right
