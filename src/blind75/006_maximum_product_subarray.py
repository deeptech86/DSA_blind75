    Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray within an array
    which has the largest product, and return the product.
    
    Args:
        nums: List[int] - Array of integers
        
    Returns:
        int - Product of contiguous subarray with largest product

    # TODO: Implement solution
    pass


# Example 1
# Input: nums = [2, 3, -2, 4]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: The subarray [2, 3] has the largest product = 6

# Example 2
# Input: nums = [-2, 0, -1]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: The result cannot be negative, so we return 0
