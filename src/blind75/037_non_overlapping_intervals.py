# Example 1
# Input: intervals = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [1, 3]]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: Remove [1, 3] and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping

# Example 2
# Input: intervals = [[1, 2], [1, 2], [1, 2]]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: You need to remove two [1, 2] intervals to make the rest non-overlapping
