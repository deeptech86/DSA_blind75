# Example 1
# Input: nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The longest consecutive sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4], so the length is 4

# Example 2
# Input: nums = [0, 3, 7, 2, 5, 8, 4, 6, 0, 1]
# Output: 9
# Explanation: The longest consecutive sequence is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], so the length is 9
